# Examples

The examples `*.md` Markdown files in this directory are examples of _literate
programming_, and are compiled using [`literally-cli`](https://github.com/texodus/literally).
You can build them from this project's source via the `yarn build:examples`
command, or with the `literally-cli` package.
